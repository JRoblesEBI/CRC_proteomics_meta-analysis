# CRC_proteomics_meta-analysis
Batch analysis output files can be found in "Solid samples" and "Secreted samples" folders. Each folder contains:
  1. The protein expression matrix (ppb.iBAQ).
  2. The bin-transformed protein abundances (ranked bins from 1 to 5).
  3. The annotation file containing sample name, dataset, condition and source.


R script used for performing Cox regression analysis to the protein expression matrix can be found in "survival analysis" folder.
